## Calculate normalized burn index 
This Google Earth Engine API helps visualize the damage done of the Mendocino Complex fire in Northern California in 2018. Using the formula,

Normalized Burn Ration = NIR - SWIR / NIR + SWIR

one could detect burned areas and estimate the severity of fires. It uses near-infrared and shortwave-infrared wavelengths.
